# Primitive

One possible way to spread knowledge, encourage reading, raise awareness, and fight the industry of ignorance is to create a platform where people can share their insights, opinions, and experiences on various topics. This platform would allow users to access a diverse range of perspectives, learn from each other, and engage in constructive dialogue. The platform would also promote literacy, critical thinking, and curiosity among its users, as well as foster a culture of respect and tolerance. By creating such a platform, we can empower people to seek the truth, challenge their assumptions, and broaden their horizons. You can access the application **[here](http://arboreal-inn-402111.oa.r.appspot.com)**.

## Why this technologies?

- **Node.js**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. It is a great choice for building highly scalable, data-intensive, and real-time applications.
- **Express.js**: Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language which builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- **MySQL**: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.
- **React**: React is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.
- **React Query**: React Query is often described as the missing data-fetching library for React, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications a breeze.
- **React Router**: React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.
- **CSS**: CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
- **Socket.IO**: Socket.IO enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication.
- **React Markdown**: React Markdown enables you to render Markdown as React components.
- **MVC Architecture**: The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller.
- **Singleton**: The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.
- **DAO**: The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern is a structural pattern that allows us to isolate the application/business layer from the persistence layer (usually a relational database, but it could be any other persistence mechanism) using an abstract API.
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Google Cloud Platform, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, file storage, and YouTube.
- **App Engine**: App Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale.
- **Cloud SQL**: Cloud SQL is a fully managed database service that makes it easy to set up, maintain, manage, and administer your relational PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server databases in the cloud.
- **Compute Engine**: Compute Engine delivers configurable virtual machines running in Google's data centers with access to high-performance networking infrastructure and block storage.
- **Git and GitHub**: Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. GitHub is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git.
- **VS Code**: Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
- **Thunder Client**: Thunder Client is a REST client extension for VS Code.
